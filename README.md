> This repository vendors the [`android-reverse-engineering-skill`](https://github.com/SimoneAvogadro/android-reverse-engineering-skill) Claude Code plugin by [@SimoneAvogadro](https://github.com/SimoneAvogadro) (Apache-2.0) so it can be installed as a local plugin marketplace in environments where `/plugin marketplace add <github-owner>/<repo>` isn't available. Use `/plugin marketplace add trial4email4timepass/free-claude` (or a local clone path) instead — see [Installation](#installation).

A Claude Code skill that decompiles Android APK/XAPK/JAR/AAR files and **extracts the HTTP APIs** used by the app — Retrofit endpoints, OkHttp calls, hardcoded URLs, authentication patterns — so you can document and reproduce them without the original source code.

> **First-class Kotlin support**: modern Android apps are Kotlin/KMP, heavily obfuscated with R8. This skill recovers the **original Kotlin class names** from metadata R8 cannot strip, and extracts APIs from **Ktor**, **Apollo (GraphQL)** and **Koin** — not just the classic Retrofit/OkHttp stack. See [Kotlin name recovery](#kotlin-name-recovery-r8-deobfuscation) below.

> **Windows / PowerShell support (experimental)**: The `*.ps1` scripts alongside the bash ones are a recent community contribution, still being stabilised. For any issues please open an issue on **this** repository (not on the contributors' upstream forks): the PowerShell scripts are maintained here by [@SimoneAvogadro](https://github.com/SimoneAvogadro).

## What it does

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Fingerprint first (Phase 0)** | Triage an APK/XAPK in seconds — detect the framework (Flutter / React Native / Cordova / Xamarin / native-Kotlin), HTTP stack, obfuscation level and native libs *before* spending time on a full decompile |
| **Decompile** | APK, XAPK, JAR, and AAR files using jadx and Fernflower/Vineflower (single engine or side-by-side comparison) |
| **Recover Kotlin names** | Rebuild original `*Repository` / `*ViewModel` / `*UseCase` class names from R8-obfuscated binaries using Kotlin metadata that R8 cannot strip |
| **Extract APIs** | Retrofit, OkHttp, Volley **and modern Kotlin/KMP stacks: Ktor, Apollo (GraphQL), Koin DI** — endpoints, hardcoded URLs, auth headers, tokens and HMAC request-signing schemes |
| **Trace call flows** | From Activities/Fragments through ViewModels and repositories down to HTTP calls |
| **Analyze structure** | Manifest, packages, architecture patterns |
| **Handle obfuscation** | R8-resistant path/URL extraction plus strategies for navigating ProGuard/R8 output |

## Requirements

**Required:**

- Java JDK 17+
- [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) (CLI)

**Optional (recommended):**

- [Vineflower](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower) or [Fernflower](https://github.com/JetBrains/fernflower) — better output on complex Java code
- [dex2jar](https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/dex2jar) — needed to use Fernflower on APK/DEX files

See `plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/references/setup-guide.md` for detailed installation instructions.

## Installation

### From this repository

Inside Claude Code, run:

```text
/plugin marketplace add trial4email4timepass/free-claude
/plugin install android-reverse-engineering@android-reverse-engineering-skill
```

If `/plugin` isn't available in your current environment (e.g. some sandboxed
or remote Claude Code sessions), you can still use the skill and scripts
directly from a checkout of this repo — see [Manual scripts](#manual-scripts)
below — and run `/plugin marketplace add` later once the command is supported.

### From the upstream repository

Inside Claude Code, run:

```text
/plugin marketplace add SimoneAvogadro/android-reverse-engineering-skill
/plugin install android-reverse-engineering@android-reverse-engineering-skill
```

The skill will be permanently available in all future sessions.

### From a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimoneAvogadro/android-reverse-engineering-skill.git
```

Then in Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/android-reverse-engineering-skill
/plugin install android-reverse-engineering@android-reverse-engineering-skill
```

## Usage

### Slash command

```text
/decompile path/to/app.apk
```

This runs the full workflow: dependency check, decompilation, and initial structure analysis.

### Natural language

The skill activates on phrases like:

- "Decompile this APK"
- "Reverse engineer this Android app"
- "Extract API endpoints from this app"
- "Follow the call flow from LoginActivity"
- "Analyze this AAR library"

### Manual scripts

The scripts can also be used standalone:

```bash
# Check dependencies
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/check-deps.sh

# Install a missing dependency (auto-detects OS and package manager)
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/install-dep.sh jadx
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/install-dep.sh vineflower

# Fingerprint an APK/XAPK BEFORE decompiling (Phase 0 triage):
# framework, HTTP stack, obfuscation level, native libs, notable SDKs
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/fingerprint.sh app.apk

# Decompile APK with jadx (default)
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh app.apk

# Decompile XAPK (auto-extracts and decompiles each APK inside)
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh app-bundle.xapk

# Decompile with Fernflower
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh --engine fernflower library.jar

# Run both engines and compare
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh --engine both --deobf app.apk

# Find API calls — defaults to a full scan across every supported stack
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --retrofit
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --urls

# Modern Kotlin/KMP stacks and obfuscation-resistant extraction
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --ktor    # Ktor client
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --apollo  # Apollo / GraphQL
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --paths   # quoted path literals that survive R8 inlining
```

### Kotlin name recovery (R8 deobfuscation)

Most real-world Kotlin/KMP apps ship through R8, so the decompiled classes come
out as `a.b.c`. R8 renames the JVM symbols but **cannot strip the Kotlin
metadata strings** — the Kotlin runtime (reflection, coroutines) needs the
original fully-qualified names at runtime. This skill mines those
`@DebugMetadata` / `@Metadata` annotations to rebuild an `obfuscated → real`
class-name map. On a typical app it recovers ~100 % of the
`*Repository` / `*ViewModel` / `*UseCase` / `*Impl` classes you actually want to
read.

```bash
# 1. Build the mapping from the decompiled sources
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/recover-kotlin-names.sh output/sources/ output/names/
#    → output/names/mapping.tsv, mapping.json, by_package/

# 2. Query it: resolve an obfuscated name, search by real name, or grep
#    the sources with each hit annotated with its recovered class name
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/lookup-name.sh output/names/ LoginRepository
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/lookup-name.sh output/names/ -o a.b.c
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/lookup-name.sh output/names/ --grep 'login' output/sources/
```
