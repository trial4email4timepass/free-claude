A pure Python yt-dlp-plugin that uses Apple WebKit to solve Youtube N/Sig, should work on most modern apple devices.

[PO Token](<https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide#youtube-po-token-guide>) support is being considered.

# Installing

## Requirements
1. Python. CPython 3.10+ and PyPy 3.11+ are supported. Other implementations and versions might or might not work.
2. A device with Apple's operating system. This plugin _should_ work on iOS/iPadOS 14.0+, and MacOS 11.0+, on x86\_64 or arm64. Other apple's operating systems might or might not work.
3. yt-dlp `2025.11.12` or above.
