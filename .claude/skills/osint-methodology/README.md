## What's in it

See the parent [README's Skill Index](../../README.md#skill-index) for the full §-by-§ breakdown.

Highlights:

- **§7 — 6-stage recon pipeline** (seed → asset expansion → enrichment → exposure analysis → convergence → operator-armed active validation) + priority order + time budgeting (1h / 4h / 1d / 1w profiles) + connector resilience (§7.3) + stage-vs-gating discipline (§7.4)
- **§8 — Asset graph discipline** with 29 typed asset types across 9 categories + per-asset-type triage rules
- **§9 — Findings rubric** anchored on examples (CRITICAL → INFO + escalation rules)
- **§10 — Pivot modes & scale tactics** (scope-sized tactics for <100 vs. large surfaces)
- **§11 — Companion-skill pointers** — the "what to do here / how in `offensive-osint`" hub: identity-fabric mapping (Entra, Okta, ADFS, Google, SAML, AWS acct-id, M365 deep), API & auth-map, JavaScript deep analysis, mobile & cloud attack surface, WAF/CDN bypass + origin discovery, vulnerability prioritization (CVE × EPSS × KEV), phishing infrastructure
- **§12 — Breach × identity correlation** (HudsonRock + HIBP + DeHashed + IntelX → SSO_EXPOSURE finding) + **§12.1 — per-person identity dossier** (PERSON × CREDENTIAL join by email, ranked spear-phish/credential-stuffing target list)
- **§13 — Specialty OSINT domains** (cryptocurrency, image/chronolocation, threat-actor investigation, people & social)
- **§15 — Bug bounty submission & responsible disclosure** (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, etc.)
- **§16 — Client deliverable templates** (exec summary + risk-translation matrix + reporting cadence)
